# Password-Manager
A password managing program that manages your password by storing your information like website name, username, url, and password.
User master password is hashed and all data is encrypted.
This requires the user to only know 1 unique password to access this program.

NOTE: DO NOT PUT BANKING INFO. THIS IS NOT TARGETED FOR YOU RICH PEOPLE. I AM A 15 YEAR OLD KID WHO MAKES THESE THINGS FOR PEOPLE OF NO IMPORTANCE LIKE ME. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY BANKING DATA LEAKS.

Thanks for trusting my program btw. Yes this is a free program but I will try my best to secure your data in return.
